/* MECK PATCH: upstream runs the APU at the Game Boy's native 32768 Hz,
 * which the ES8311 codec's clock table on the T-Display P4 does not
 * support ("search _clock_coeff_list fail" in the bus driver, codec left
 * unclocked, silent playback). 44100 Hz is the audiobook player's proven
 * rate on this codec. Every APU timing quantity derives from this macro
 * (FREQ_INC_REF = rate * 16, all integer maths), so the synthesis stays
 * exact; the per-frame sample count becomes 738. */
